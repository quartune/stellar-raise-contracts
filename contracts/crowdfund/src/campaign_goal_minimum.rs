//! # campaign_goal_minimum
//!
//! @title   CampaignGoalMinimum — Extracted constants and enforcement logic
//!          for campaign goal and minimum contribution threshold validation.
//!
//! @notice  This module centralizes every magic number and threshold used
//!          during campaign initialization and contribution validation.
//!          Extracting them into named constants eliminates repeated literals
//!          scattered across the contract, reduces the risk of inconsistent
//!          values, and makes the intent of each guard immediately clear to
//!          reviewers.
//!
//! @dev     All constants are `pub` so that `lib.rs` and test modules can
//!          import them from a single source of truth.  No runtime state is
//!          held here — this module is purely compile-time constants plus
//!          pure validation helpers.
//!
//! ## Gas-efficiency rationale
//!
//! Before this refactor the contract contained inline literals such as
//! `10_000` (fee cap in bps), `0` (zero-amount guard), and the minimum-goal
//! floor.  Each occurrence forced the reader to infer intent from context and
//! made audits error-prone.  Named constants:
//!
//! - Are resolved at compile time — zero runtime cost.
//! - Appear in a single place, so a future change touches one line.
//! - Enable the compiler to catch type mismatches at the call site.
//!
//! ## Security assumptions
//!
//! 1. `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT` prevents campaigns with a zero or trivially small
//!    goal that could be exploited to immediately trigger "goal reached" and
//!    allow the creator to withdraw dust amounts.
//! 2. `MIN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT` prevents zero-amount contributions that waste
//!    gas on a no-op token transfer and pollute the contributors list.
//! 3. `MAX_PLATFORM_FEE_BPS` caps the platform fee at 100 % (10 000 bps) so
//!    the contract can never be configured to steal all contributor funds.
//! 4. `PROGRESS_BPS_SCALE` is the single authoritative scale factor for all
//!    basis-point progress calculations; using it everywhere prevents
//!    off-by-one errors when the scale changes.
//! 5. `MIN_DEADLINE_OFFSET` ensures the campaign deadline is always in the
//!    future relative to the ledger timestamp at initialization, preventing
//!    campaigns that are dead-on-arrival.
//!
//! ## Validation flow
//!
//! ```text

///
/// @dev    Returns a `&'static str` rather than `ContractError` so this module
///         stays free of the contract's error type and can be used in off-chain
///         tooling without pulling in the full contract dependency.

/// [`ContractError::GoalTooLow`] on failure.
///
/// @notice  This is the on-chain enforcement entry point.  Call this inside
///          `initialize()` before persisting any campaign state so that a
///          below-threshold goal is rejected atomically with no side-effects.
///
/// @dev     The `_env` parameter is accepted for API consistency with other
///          Soroban validation helpers and to allow future ledger-aware
///          threshold logic (e.g. governance-controlled minimums stored in
///          contract storage) without a breaking signature change.

///
/// A campaign goal below `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT` (currently 1 token unit) would:
/// - Allow a zero-goal campaign to be immediately "successful" after any
///   contribution, letting the creator drain funds with no real commitment.
/// - Create "dust" campaigns that consume a ledger entry for negligible value,
///   wasting network resources and increasing state bloat.
/// - Undermine platform credibility by permitting economically meaningless
///   campaigns that could be used for spam or griefing.
///

/// is a single signed integer comparison — no arithmetic is performed, so
